    	<p>
    		I was born in Littleton, Colorado, but raised in Sacramento, California.
    		Shortly out of high school I performed numerous jobs ranging from the
    		restaurant industry to the automobile industry. I also did construction
    		and worked on petitioning for state bills, among many other various jobs.
    	</p>
    		
    	<p>
    		My jobs have always been diverse, as have my travels been. I've traveled
    		around the US quite a bit; at times just simply deciding to move and
    		live somewhere else for the pure experience of it. My thirst for the awe
    		of the moment soon found a place in my work life as well.

    	<p>
    		Out of sheer will I took it upon myself to craft my skills as a writer. I
    		had always been fascinated with writing of all sorts so I decided to
    		experience it for myself. After a couple years of practicing writing,
    		with no degree mind you, I landed a couple jobs with some monthly
    		literature magazines, a night life magazine, and even a local newspaper.
    	</p>
    		
    	<p> 
    		Writing for the local newspaper of my hometown is what led me into the
    		Army; after being sent to cover a story at an Army base in Missouri.
    		Just as I had always been interested in writing I was also interested in
    		reconnasaince of sorts. Being a detective, investigative reporter, or
    		Navy Seal were thing of my childhood dreams. Shortly after hearing about
    		such a job in the US Army I took the plung and became a	Cavalry Scout in
    		the 10th Mountain Division.
    	</p>

    	<p>
    		I served three years in active duty and pulled one tour in Afghanistan.
    		After an honorable discharge my curiosity had peaked once again. Growing
    		up during the computer/internet boom of the 90's had engrained in me a
    		deep fascination with computers and everything related. Just as	I had
    		done before with every major decision in my life; I saw something I
    		wanted to do and set out to do it. Now I am currently enrolled at Weber
    		State University as a Computer Science major and I'm loving every minute
    		of it.
